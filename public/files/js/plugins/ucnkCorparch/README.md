# ucnkCorparch

This is a slightly modified frontend for the `corparch` plug-in as required by the CNC.
It works best with `mysql_corparch` on the server side. The main difference between
this one and `corparch` is that `ucnkCorparch` allows users to ask for access to
specific "locked" corpora (= corpora visible when searching for a corpus but not accessible by
default).
